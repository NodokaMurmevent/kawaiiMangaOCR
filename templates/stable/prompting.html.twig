<h2>PROMPTING</h2>

<h3>Positive Prompt <small>(or just "Prompt")</small></h3>
<p>
	For prompts, there are two schools of thought, which can be mixed: keyword and sentence.
</p>
<p>
    <code>2 girls playing at the river</code>
	or
	<code>2girls, playing, river</code>
</p>
<p>
	What do you need to use? Simple : look what the creator of your model said is better to use.
</p>

<h4>It’s totally possible to mix them. For example</h4>	
<pre class="not-prose"><code>(best quality, masterpiece:1.2), (2 girls running outside:1.1), blue sportwear, joyful, happy, open mouth,  sweat, (hot:1.1), sun</code></pre>

<p>
	The order of your keywords is important. The further your keyword is from the beginning, the less powerful it is.
</p>

<h4>Full typical prompt example</h4>
	
<pre class="not-prose"><code>{{'(best quality, masterpiece:1.2), 1girl, standing, solo, pose, big eyes, wide oval eyes, one eye closed, lip liner , (photoshoot studio:1.1), huge breasts, 
skinny, skindentation, 
one side up, purple eyes, light brown hair, big hair, 
thick thighs, (pink luxury fashion:1.1), very dark skin, ebony, 
<lora:GoodHands-vanilla:1> nice hands, perfect hands' | escape("html") }}</code></pre>

<ul>
	<li class="leading-none text-yellow-400">Generic keyword quality</li>
	<li class="leading-none text-blue-300">Character infos</li>
	<li class="leading-none text-green-500">Character Details</li>
	<li class="leading-none text-pink-300">Location keywords</li>
	<li class="leading-none text-red-500">Quality details</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Prompt Syntaxe</h3>

<p class="italic font-medium text-cyan-300">«Hey I write big breast in my prompt it’s doing nothing! My waifu is flat.»</p>

<p>
	At some point in your prompt, you'll probably want to modulate a particular word more or less strongly. To do this, the interface allows this syntax:
</p>
<p>
	use <code>(big breast:1.1)</code> will be more significant. never go further than 1.3, it's useless, even counterproductive.
</p>
<p class="italic font-medium text-cyan-300">
	«Hey I write big breast in my prompt but it’s too strong ! My waifu as massive big tiddies.»
</p>
<p>
	Use <code>(big breast:0.9)</code> will be more significant. <br/>
	Tips : you can use a negative value. It’s rare, but some overloader support this. Referee to the notes from the creator.
</p>
<p>
	<h3>Negative prompt</h3>

	The prompt lets you say what you want. The negative prompt lets you say what you don't want.
</p>
<p>
	Don't underestimate the power of the negative prompt. It's a powerful tool for improving the rendering and stability of your prompts.
</p>
<p>
	You can also put Lora, Embedding etc… in negative prompt.

<h5>More complex negative prompt</h5>
<img src=" {{ asset('build/images/stable/prompting-2.webp') }}" alt="hide-sampler">

<h5>Example with some embedding </h5>
<p>The trouble with negative prompts. It's hard to know what to put in them, and they can get very long.</p>
<p>One of the best solutions is to use negative embeddings. Think of them as keywords that embed hundreds of other keywords.</p>
<p>For start, you can using them:</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="https://civitai.com/models/4629/deep-negative-v1x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easy Negative</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://civitai.com/models/56519/negativehand-negative-embedding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Negative Hand</a></li>
    <li> <a href="https://civitai.com/models/5224?modelVersionId=6056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bad Artist (anime)</a></li>
</ul>
